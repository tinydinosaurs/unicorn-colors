# colors 🌈

One of my favorites resources for quickly finding named CSS colors is [147 Colors | CSS Color Names](http://www.colors.commutercreative.com/). It's a great resource if all you need is the named color. But sometimes I want the hex code or RGB value for a particular color so I can create tints, tones, and hues.

## objective

I decided to make a React project with a bit of additional information about the named colors. I'm a newish React developer, so I use React whenever it makes sense. For this project, I'm creating a json object of color data, and building out a few components to display that information. Visitors to the site will be able select a color and find out more information about it. They'll also be able to sort colors by hue family (reds, blues, etc.).

## additional features

I'll be brainstorming additional features while I'm working on the basic project, and probably for awhile afterward. I'm not trying to recreate colour lovers, coolors, or other palette-oriented web app, so I don't want to go crazy with user accounts and whatnot. But I might do things like add a color picker, which is relatively easy, and possibly an add to clipboard feature so people can easily copy pieces of color data. We'll see.
